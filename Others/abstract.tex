 This document contain a description of the development stages of the Theoprax end of course project, the ELIR, a autonomous robot for inspection transmission lines, meeting the general and specific objectives and the requirements established by the client, considering the need of the project in a scenario both commercial and academic. During the development of the project, it was necessary to carry out the study of robotics concepts, as well as the software required to implement the functionalities, also studied and defined by the group. In parallel with the development of the functionalities, several tests were carried out to validate the concepts and verify errors, in individual test stages, starting to the integrated testing stage. 
The concepts studied and developed by the group throughout the project are part of a great technological contribution to the area of robotics and engineering, being a project enriching both for the team involved in in development and for the team involved in development and for future generations interested in the technological development in robotics.
